// left edge of the two home cards, focus rings, active chips. Nothing else.

// One secondary accent family, not several. GLOW, EMBER, and this are all
// real PICO-8 palette colours (10 yellow, 9 orange, 4 brown) — same
// discipline BRAND itself follows (PICO-8 8). Used where an ordinal "how far
// along" ramp needs more range than grey alone — today, just
// SEGMENT_COLORS below. Explored at SegmentColorLabPage (archive/design-labs) against a
// brand-forward (all-red) ramp, a cool blue ramp, and single-hue-only EMBER
// and GLOW ramps before landing on this three-step blend.
//
// A second, cool secondary (blue) was considered for contrast variety and
// set aside — nothing needs it yet, and BRAND.md's "don't add a second
// accent" discipline argues against introducing one speculatively. Revisit
// only if a real need shows up (e.g. a chart wanting more than three
// distinguishable ordinal steps).

// from the amber run, since it's a regression flag ("just got this wrong"),
// not a further step in the getting-brighter progression; folding it into
// the amber ramp would make it read as more-mastered, not less.
//
// Was a teal-green ramp before the rebrand (learning #4c8a7d / young #5eb6a2
